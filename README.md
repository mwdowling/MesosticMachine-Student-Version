# MesosticMachine-Archive

This archive includes:

The first version of the MesosticsMachine (designed for Java 1.8) submitted as part of the Final Project on MSc Software Development, Queen's University of Belfast, 2017. This version of the MesosticsMachine is fully functional, but it's purpose here is archival. It will have been superceded by the MesosticsMachine-2018, held in a separate repository on this GitHub site.

The dissertation submitted along with the Java software system as part of the Final Project on MSc Software Development, Queen's University of Belfast, 2017.

A copy of the "Circus On" score by John Cage, which the MesosticMachine helps to implement.

A document translating parts of the Cage score into a Requirements Specification for the software system.  

Further information on "Owenvarragh: A Belfast Circus On The Star Factory", a realization of the Cage score created by Ãšna Monaghan and myself, in collaboration with the poet Ciaran Carson, in 2012, which is the inspiration and test data for the MesosticsMachine, is available in a portfolio published in a special John Cage Issue of the Black Mountain College Studies Journal at this site:
